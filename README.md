### Heartfailure_prediction

#### Overview
- This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the risk of heart failure, utilizing the Kaggle dataset on heart failure patients. The predictive model, built using Logistic Regression, achieves an impressive 85% cross-validation accuracy. Early detection of heart failure risk is crucial for proactive healthcare interventions, and this model aims to contribute to that objective.

#### Dataset
- The model is trained on the Heart Failure Prediction Kaggle dataset, which includes a comprehensive set of features related to heart health. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the data directory before running the code.

#### Model Performance
- The Logistic Regression model achieves an 85% accuracy in cross-validation, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting heart failure risk.

#### Uses of the Model
1-Early Intervention: Identify individuals at high risk of heart failure for early medical intervention and lifestyle modifications.

2-Healthcare Resource Optimization: Allocate medical resources more efficiently by focusing on high-risk individuals.

3-Patient Education: Provide personalized health information to individuals, empowering them to make informed decisions about their well-being.
